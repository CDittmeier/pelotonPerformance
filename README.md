# pelotonPerformance

### Christian Dittmeier

This project uses the [pelotonr package by bweiher](https://github.com/bweiher/pelotonR) to generate a performance report using Peloton credentials. In the future, it would likely be better to use the "download workouts" output from the peloton website in order to make the report accessible. 

### The report
